Create over 200 octilion different bingo cards (if I did my [math](https://github.com/catzAreVeryCute/huntshowdown-bingo/issues/1) right) at random using 35 different bingo tiles! Save the bingo card as image, or use the application to mark up the bingo card just by clicking on the tile. Even add your own bingo tiles to the mix! If you're curious as to what the different tiles, navigate into the project's assets folder and click on the "tiles" folder.
